## The 1.0 Contract

When `key-vault 1.0.0` ships, it commits to:

### Functional contract

- **`KeyVault`** — main vault type with builder API
- **`KeyHandle`** — opaque reference, never exposes raw bytes
- **`KeyFetch` trait** with 4 built-in implementations (Keychain, File, Env, TPM detection-only at 1.0)
- **`FragmentStrategy` trait** with 4 built-in implementations (Standard, Interleaved, Random, Layered)
- **`DecoyStrategy` trait** with 3 built-in implementations (Random, SelfReference, KeyDerived)
- **`Codex` trait** with 4 built-in implementations (Identity, Static, Dynamic, FnCodex)
- **`SecurityMonitor` trait** with 4 built-in implementations (None, Log, Metrics, Webhook, Composite)
- **TEE detection** — `detect_tee_capabilities()` for Intel SGX/TDX, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone, Apple SE, AWS Nitro
- **Memory protection** — mlock + zeroize + page guards + (optional) page protection toggling
- **Master key recovery** — fallback path
- **Key rotation** — atomic swap
- **Multi-key vaults** — named keys with independent lifecycles
- **Key normalization** — BLAKE3 input hashing to neutralize format pattern leaks
- **Cross-platform parity** — Linux, macOS, Windows

### Performance contract (verified by benchmark)

| Key access (defrag with codex) | <1µs |
| Concurrent reads on same handle | lock-free, no degradation |
| Memory overhead per key | <16 KiB |
| Zero allocations on hot path | verified by dhat |

### Security contract (nuclear-proof requirement)

| Property | Verification |
|----------|--------------|
| Zero unsafe code in public API | code review + Miri |

**Effort:** 5-6 days. **Actual:** shipped 2026-05-20.

### Tasks

- [x] Design `KeyHandle` - opaque reference type
  - Internal: `KeyId` (`NonZeroU64`), allocated from a process-global counter

  - No deserialization (handles are runtime-only)
- [x] Design `KeyMetadata` - metadata about a key (algorithm hint, length, registration time)

  - [x] Apple Secure Enclave detection (`Detected` on Apple Silicon)
  - [x] AWS Nitro detection (DMI sys_vendor on Linux)
  - [x] Returns `TeeCapabilities` struct
- [x] Unit tests for KeyHandle opacity (1024-handle Debug sweep + targeted)
- [x] First doctest examples (codex, vault, handle, tee)
- [x] CHANGELOG updated
- [x] .dev/release/v0.2.0.md

### Exit criteria

- [x] No real storage yet (stubs OK)
- [x] CI gate (fmt + clippy + test + doc) green locally

### Carry-over notes

- MSRV bumped from 1.75 → 1.85 to resolve a pre-existing conflict with
  `edition = "2024"`. CI matrix updated to match.

---

## Phase 0.3.0 - StandardFragmenter + mlock + zeroize (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Layers 2, 3, 7 functional. The core memory protection working.

**Effort:** 1 week. **Actual:** shipped 2026-05-20.

### Tasks

- [x] **Layer 3: `StandardFragmenter`:**
  - [x] Variable chunk sizes (configurable range, default 1–8)
  - [x] Variable chunk count
  - [x] Per-call random seed (getrandom-sourced)
  - [x] Position map (stored separately in `LockedBytes`)
  - [x] Defrag (reassembly) logic
- [x] **Layer 2: mlock integration (via `LockedBytes`):**
  - [x] Linux `mlock(2)` + munlock (`libc`)
  - [x] macOS `mlock(2)` + munlock (`libc`)
  - [x] Windows `VirtualLock` + `VirtualUnlock` (`windows-sys`)
  - [x] Graceful fallback if mlock not permitted (`LockedBytes::is_locked` reports false; buffer still works)
- [x] **Layer 7: zeroize integration:**
  - [x] All fragment buffers volatile-zeroed at drop
  - [x] Layout buffer also locked + zeroed
  - [x] Intermediate plaintext layout copy zeroed before dropping
  - [ ] `dhat`-verified memory overwrite (deferred to Phase 0.11 security hardening)
- [x] **Key normalization:**
  - [x] BLAKE3 input hashing
  - [x] Configurable via `KeyVaultBuilder::normalize_with_blake3()` (wired through end-to-end)
- [x] **Layer 6: constant-time equality**
  - [x] `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` on `KeyHandle` (with consistent `PartialEq` + `Hash`)
- [x] Unit tests:
  - [x] Fragment -> defrag round-trip identical
  - [x] Multiple fragmentations produce different layouts
  - [x] Stress: 1000-iteration round-trip
  - [ ] mlock actually prevents swap on Linux `/proc/self/status` (deferred to 0.11)
- [ ] Property tests (proptest) — deferred to 0.11 (basic coverage via 1000-iteration stress)

### Exit criteria

- [x] `StandardFragmenter` functional with mlock + zeroize
- [x] All 3 platforms compile and pass CI (Linux, macOS, Windows × stable + MSRV 1.85)
- [x] Round-trip verified across input sizes 1B–4KiB and 1000 iterations
- [x] No build warnings, all REPS lints respected

### Carry-over notes / deferred to later phases

- `dhat` memory-residency verification and `proptest` property tests
  pushed to Phase 0.11.0 (security hardening) where they are grouped
  with fuzzing.
- Linux `/proc/self/status` mlock-actually-locked verification also
  deferred to 0.11.
- CI: swapped `actions/cache@v4` → `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` (resolves
  Node.js 20 deprecation notice).

---

## Phase 0.4.0 - Decoy strategies (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Layer 4 (decoy bytes) working with all three strategies.

**Effort:** 4-5 days. **Actual:** shipped 2026-05-20.

### Tasks

- [x] **Layer 4: `RandomDecoy`** (raw RNG bytes — fastest)
- [x] **Layer 4: `SelfReferenceDecoy`** (real key bytes as filler — strongest)
- [x] **Layer 4: `KeyDerivedDecoy`** (BLAKE3-XOF derived from key + per-call nonce)
- [x] Decoy generation integrates with `FragmentStrategy` (via
  `StandardFragmenter::with_decoy`); decoy chunks share the size range and
  shuffle ordering of real chunks.
- [x] `KeyVaultBuilder::with_decoy` fluent forwarder
- [x] Tests for each decoy strategy:
  - [x] Output length matches request
  - [x] `SelfReferenceDecoy` bytes are all drawn from the key's byte set
  - [x] Two consecutive `generate` calls produce different output
- [x] End-to-end vault tests: each decoy strategy + fragment + defragment
  round-trip recovers the original bytes byte-for-byte
- [ ] Output length configurable via `frag_len` setting — deferred to 0.5.0
  (paired with the additional fragment strategies)
- [ ] Symbol whitelist support (`frag_symbols` config) — deferred to 0.5.0
- [ ] Formal statistical-indistinguishability test (chi-squared / dudect) —
  deferred to Phase 0.11 (security hardening)

### Exit criteria

- [x] 3 decoy strategies functional
- [x] All three round-trip cleanly through the public vault API
- [x] `SelfReferenceDecoy` empirically verified to draw only from the key's
  byte set (unit test sweeps 1024 outputs)
- [ ] Symbol whitelist works — deferred to 0.5.0

### Carry-over notes

- `frag_len` configuration and `frag_symbols` whitelist deferred to 0.5.0
  where they will be paired with `InterleavedFragmenter`/`RandomFragmenter`
  that need them too.
- Formal statistical distinguisher test deferred to 0.11 (fuzz / dudect
  phase).

- [ ] **`DynamicCodex`**:
  - [ ] Per-vault randomized involution generated at vault creation
  - [ ] Stored in protected memory
- [ ] **`FnCodex<F>`**:
  - [ ] Wraps user-provided closure
  - [ ] Documented: closure must be involution (encode == decode)
- [ ] Codex integration in fragment storage:
  - [ ] All bytes (real + decoy) pass through codex.encode() on storage
  - [ ] codex.decode() applied during defrag
- [ ] Feature-gated behind `codex` Cargo feature (default off)
- [ ] Unit tests for involution property: `decode(encode(x)) == x`

## Roadmap discipline (MAX PRIORITY enforcement)

- Every task has a checkbox - tracked explicitly
- Every phase has exit criteria - no advancement without exit cleanly
- No skipping phases without explicit written justification
- No performance claim without committed benchmark (the contract requires this)
- No security claim without verification (fuzz, dhat, dudect, etc.)
- CHANGELOG updated under [Unreleased] every commit
- `Milestone Update vX.Y.Z` commit format for releases
- Premium quality on documentation throughout — this is competing with established players
